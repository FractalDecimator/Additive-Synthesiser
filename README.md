# Additive-Synthesizer
Additive synthesis is a sound synthesis technique that creates multiple timbres of a sound by adding different sine waves of various amplitude together.The timbre of musical instruments are calculated through Fourier transform that consists of odd and even harmonics usually termed partials or overtones. Each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that bumps and decays over time due to modulation parameter such as envelope or low frequency oscillator.  Additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. Alternative implementations may use pre-computed wavetables or the inverse Fast Fourier transform to create re-synthesis.
